        <p id="ts1" class="bird" style="text-align:left;">With the continuing innovation of unmanned drone technology, and the ever increasing threat of a robot uprising, now more than ever it's important to know the difference between birds and drones.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p id="ts2" class="bird">At the Brotherhood of Interspecies Recognition and Demilitarization, we strive to bring about a world where humanity can live alongside our world's bird population in peace. We envision a world where aggression between our two species is a thing of the past, and where we can unite against our true enemies in the skies.</p>
        <p id="ts3" class="bird"> In our pursuit of this goal we have composed this guide to help citizens make informed decisions when encountering our neighbors in the sky.</p>
        
        <h2>So you see something flying, what now?</h2>
        <p id="ts4" class="bird">The threat of drones in our skies is indeed great, but we must not forget our fragile alliance with bird-kind. A discerning eye and sound judgement is necessary in order to preserve both ourselves and our allies.</p>
        <p id="ts5" class="bird">Humans have many tools at their disposal, and we recommend using multiple senses when trying to identify a flying object:</p>
        <ul id="ts6" class="bird">
            <li><strong>Look:</strong> Use your eyes to evaluate the shape of the flying object. Is it round? Square? Triangular? Trapezoidal? Take note of the specific shape and consider drawing a picture to present to authorities</li>
            <li><strong>Listen:</strong> Try to take note of any sounds coming from the object. A buzzing or humming sound would indicate a drone and be cause for alarm. A higher "tweeting" sound is most likely to come from a bird, in which case you can be at ease.</li>
            <li><strong>Feel:</strong> Try to feel if there's a breeze coming down from above. Most drones use propellers for lift and a downward breeze will be a dead giveaway.</li>
        </ul>

        </figure>
        
        <h2 style="clear:both">What to do if you've found a drone</h2>
        <p id="ts9" class="bird">Above all, rememeber that <strong>dones are an enemy.</strong> If you believe you've found a drone, contact your local resistance group and do you best not to lose sight of the drone. If no immediate danger is presented remember to stay calm.</p>
        <p id="ts10" class="bird">For additional information on how to identify a bird please review <a href="https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/features/birdanatomy/">this anatomy guide.</a> Remember, in these trying times <strong>knowledge is power!</strong></p>
