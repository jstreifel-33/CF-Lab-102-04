        <h1>Birds, drones, and knowing the difference.</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center; size:200%">With the continuing innovation of unmanned drone technology, and the ever increasing threat of a robot uprising, now more than ever it's important to know the difference between birds and drones.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="start">At the Brotherhood of Interspecies Recognition and Demilitarization, we strive to bring about a world where humanity can live alongside our world's bird population in peace. We envision a world where aggression between our two species is a thing of the past, and where we can unite against our true enemies in the skies.</p>
        <p> In our pursuit of this goal we have composed this guide to help citizens make informed decisions when encountering our neighbors in the sky.</p>
        <h2>So you see something flying, what now?</h2>
        <p class="start">The threat of drones in our skies is indeed great, but we must not forget our fragile alliance with bird-kind. A discerning eye and sound judgement is necessary in order to preserve both ourselves and our allies.</p>
        <p>Humans have many tools at their disposal, and we recommend using multiple senses when trying to identify a flying object:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Look:</strong> Use your eyes to evaluate the shape of the flying object. Is it round? Square? Triangular? Trapezoidal? Take note of the specific shape and consider drawing a picture to present to authorities</li>
            <li><strong>Listen:</strong> Try to take note of any sounds coming from the object. A buzzing or humming sound would indicate a drone and be cause for alarm. A higher "tweeting" sound is most likely to come from a bird, in which case you can be at ease.</li>
            <li><strong>Feel:</strong> Try to feel if there's a breeze coming down from above. Most drones use propellers for lift and a downward breeze will be a dead giveaway.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="clear:both">What to do if you've found a drone</h2>
        <p class="start">Above all, rememeber that <strong>dones are an enemy.</strong> If you believe you've found a drone, contact your local resistance group and do you best not to lose sight of the drone. If no immediate danger is presented remember to stay calm.</p>
